# Project overview
The main goal is to develop reliable service for communicating with drone via MAVlink protocol to send through this service GPS coordinates of its position
to the HoloLens2 system. HoloLens are responsible for projecting virtual track within the drone is localized and the C# scripts control the mission in terms of checkpoints passing
as well as collisions detections. Later also some UI with telemetry data is to be implemented.
